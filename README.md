Our NFT Marketplace project provides a dynamic platform where art pieces, digital collections, and unique digital assets can be bought and sold, offering art enthusiasts and collectors the opportunity to trade their digital assets. Users can list and sell their creative works or collections in the form of NFTs. Additionally, as a distinctive feature of our platform, individuals organizing various events can create POAP (Provable Ownership of Attendance Protocol) to award exclusive digital badges to users attending the events.
Users participating in these events can convert their earned POAPs into BEETOKEN on the platform. BEETOKEN serves as the platform's native cryptocurrency, enabling users to engage in trading with unique club products. Users can exchange their BEETOKENs for exclusive items featured in the platform's store, expanding their special collections. This way, NFT holders not only engage in buying and selling digital assets but also earn rewards by participating in events, which they can later exchange for the platform's unique products.
